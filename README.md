# iOS-HW2-Carousel

This is the 2nd homework.

On click of fields, I am using the transforms from the labs, and I think this is causing a problem with the scrolling and keeping the fields on screen. This is possibly also compounded by the alert screens, maybe causing the page to reload and thereby resetting the initial y values.

I think everything else is working.
